My second project in The Odin Project curicculum.

Creating a Rock, Paper, Scissors game in JavaScript.

I've learned a lot during this project.

I've strengthened my knowledge of CSS and HTML, I've learned about if statements and the basics of DOM manipulation.
I got comfortable creating functions and much more.

In general, this project was a great challange where I took, what seemed to me is, a big problem, took it apart to a number of small problems and then solved them one by one.

What got me the most stuck was finding out a way how to synchronize (basicaly reset) the transition of the buttons even when they were being clicked quickly.
